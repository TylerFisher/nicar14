					<h1>How to raise an army</h1>

						Hello! My name is Tyler Fisher, and I’m a senior here at Medill. I’ve been asked to talk to you to share some of the things I’ve learned about the web and about programming during my time here at Northwestern.

					<h3 class="jubilat">Finding talent at Northwestern should be easier.</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						By the end of freshman year, all the other members of the interactive team had graduated or stopped participating, so I was left in charge of the section. I still had no idea, really, how to code. But the pressure of having to teach other people how to code in weekly meetings made me learn. I stayed one step ahead of my producers through online tutorials and late-night experimenting.

					<h3 class="jubilat">How do we make the Knight Lab a community of webmakers?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						I also found the necessary pressure through taking some classes at Northwestern that put me on a team that had to develop a product by the end of the quarter. The pressure of being responsible for not only your own grade, but also your peers’ grades, is certainly one that can make you stay up all night hacking away on a project.

						Once I got good enough, I managed to get some internships and fellowships that actually paid me to code. So now, I really had to perform. Somebody paid me real money to produce working products.
