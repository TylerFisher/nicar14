					<aside class="notes">
						Hello! My name is Tyler Fisher, and Iâ€™m a senior at the Medill School of Journalism. I also intern with the NPR Visuals Team doing news apps. I'm going to talk about how to raise an army; that is, how to get journalists invested in and building for the web from my experience at Northwestern.
					</aside>

				<section data-state="title-slide">
					<h1 class="title-slide-text">Whose army?</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, what army are we talking about here? Well, my army is here.

					</a>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I am an undergraduate fellow at the Knight Lab at Northwestern, and we've brought 8 fellows to this year's NICAR. For many of them, it is their first NICAR and their first year building for the web. They're all amazing, and you should meet all of them.</p>

						<p>But getting to them wasn't easy. We graduated a bunch of undergraduate fellows in 2013, and had a ton of open positions. We just had no idea who we were going to hire.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 class="jubilat">Finding talent at Northwestern should be easier.</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						We put out some calls for fellows, and we got a lot of interested students with no experience. They had no experience because Medill had never exposed them to the web in any meaningful way. So the question became, how can we take this interest and turn it into talent?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 class="jubilat">How do we make the Knight Lab a <strong>community</strong> of webmakers?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Put another way: How do we make the Knight Lab a **community** of webmakers at Northwestern? How can we be a place that welcomes new people as well as enriches the experience of skilled journalists?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-state="title-slide">
					<h1 class="title-slide-text">Community building</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						Instead of focusing on building new software, as fellows typically did at the Knight Lab, we started focusing on building a new community. We came up with three major initiatives.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Brown bag lunches</h2>
					<p>Informal discussions about journalism and tech</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						The first is our simplest: weekly brown bag lunches. They're informal discussions about journalism and technology. Anyone is welcome to stop by the lab during lunch and join us. We usually have no set agenda. We just want to get people talking.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Brown bag lunches</h2>
					<p>Nerds want to feel validated in their nerdiness.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						And that's important because, when you're a nerd, you want to feel validated in your nerdiness. You want to meet other people who think like you do. For example, "Oh, I really thought that map in that interactive could have been better, too! Let's talk about it! Let's talk about how we can make better maps!"
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2><a href="http://learn.knightlab.com" target="_blank">Learn.knightlab.com</a></h2>
					<p>A self-guided curriculum for digital literacy</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When we had an interested student who wanted to learn, we needed a resource to point them to. So I built this simple website called learn.knightlab.com. It's a self-guided curriculum for digital literacy. That is, it compiles some of the best tutorials and articles about journalism and the web online and presents them in a lesson-style format so that students don't have to dig around for the right next step. The path is laid out for them.</p>

						<p>At this time, the site starts from learning how the internet works and builds skills through basic JavaScript. In that period, students learn HTML, CSS, the command line and git, and they build their own personal portfolio site.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Open Lab Hours</h2>
					<p>A physical space for makers and learners.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, and perhaps most successfully, we hold Open Lab Hours once a week for three hours on a weeknight. It's a physical space for makers and learners. Anybody is welcome to come with any project they want and work on it. They can ask questions of the current Lab fellows and get assistance. The point is to come in and work on something, and realize you're not alone in working on cool projects.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Open Lab Hours</h2>
					<p>Student-run, student-owned.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Importantly, the Lab is run by students, so the students own how the night goes. If everyone wants to hack together on one project, they can. If they want a fellow to give a short presentation on something cool, that can happen too. Having the Open Lab Hours gives students something to own. Even if they aren't fellows at the Lab yet, they feel like they're a part of something and keep coming back.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-state="title-slide">
					<h1 class="title-slide-text">Lessons</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, here are some short lessons I've learned that are more widely applicable.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="jubilat">Kill imposter syndrome.</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						We need to kill imposter syndrome. The biggest hurdle in getting journalists to start coding is convincing them that they belong. I built a Tumblr called newsnerdfirsts.tumblr.com that compiles the first projects ever put on the web by some of our finest news nerds. They all suck. It's amazing. It makes students realize that learning to code is a long process, and everyone started out sucking.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="jubilat">Having a physical space encourages learning.</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Having a physical space encourages learning. I found that, with Open Lab Nights people got excited by being around other programmers and learning together. Giving interested journalists a place to come and learn is better than telling them to go learn at home.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="jubilat">We have the technology.</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, we have the technology. We don't need to reinvent the wheel every time we want to teach someone to code. We have great tutorials out there. The real work that needs to be done is in communicating the importance of learning at all. I hope you'll join me in that battle, and we can raise an ever-larger army of news nerds that can transform journalism.
